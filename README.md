# File Difference Finder for Local & Remote Directories #

### What is this? ###

A utility to find file differences between local & remote in just one load, i used Filezilla File Difference but i had to go through to the entire directory to find the differences so made this utility, it will scan all files & folders under directories that will be mentioned in rule list. You can add some folders to ignore list to increase response time. File difference algorithm is simple and it is not precise enough as it is initial version. Best usage will be when you're working on existing project or unfortunately not taking advantages of any VCS.

P.S: UI ain't good enough, i would appreciate if anyone help me out in UI. Please fork this repo and create a pull request for that.

### Requirement ###
* PHP 5.3 or above.
* `fileDiff-client.php` is supposed to be in your development machine (as it might expose your codebase)

### Setup Guide ###

* Open `fileDiff-server.php`, Add your folders to scan and ignore variable (make sure path should be relative or full path)
* Upload `fileDiff-server.php` to your accessible server.
* Open `fileDiff-client.php`, Specify your basepath, HTTP URL path of that file which we uploaded `fileDiff-server.php` Add your folders to ignore on local to scan
* Update and make sure **ENCRYPTION_KEY** is same on both client and server file.
* Thats it. You're ready to go

### Configure Difference Viewer for files (Optional)
* Checkout https://github.com/chrisboulton/php-diff library anywhere in your system.
* Set absolute path in `fileDiff-client.php` for **PHP_DIFF_LIBRARY_PATH** constant.

### Folder Scan Guide ###
* Wildcard folder scanning supported on both `client` and `server` file.
* `Classes/*.php` will scan each files under `Classes` directory with extension **.php**
* `.txt` will scan **.txt** files under *basePath* directory.

### Ignore Scanning Guide ###
* `*/error_log` will ignore scanning on every directory, but `error_log` will just ignore on *basePath* root.
